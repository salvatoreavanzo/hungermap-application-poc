This repository has been created to solve an assignment requiring a PoC of a web app freely inspired by the [WFP Hunger Map](https://hungermap.wfp.org).  

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can access the application also in AWS [here](https://main.d273w8pax1ngw.amplifyapp.com).
